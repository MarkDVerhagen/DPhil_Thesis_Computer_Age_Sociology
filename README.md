4. Chapter 5: [Using Causal Trees and Registry Data to Study the Equitability of Policy Interventions: The Dutch Decentralization of the Social Domain](https://github.com/MarkDVerhagen/heterogeneity_social_assistance)

Each repository includes its own `README.md`, which provides further documentation and background information for the chapter.
